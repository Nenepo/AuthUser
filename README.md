### Summary

- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` to store sensitive data and `dotenv` to load them.
- **Project Structure**: Organize files logically and use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- **Code Quality**: Use ESLint for consistent coding standards and write tests for reliability.
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive information and keep dependencies updated.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a comprehensive README and comment your code.

These best practices will help you create a robust, secure, and well-documented project, making it stand out in your portfolio.
